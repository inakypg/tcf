# This is a generic systemd unit to run system-wide TTBD
#
# - run as root: systemctl enable ttbd@[tag].service
#
# Note it is set to user ttbd, so you will likely have permission
# issues. For your system's deployment, you will want to copy this to
# another name and set the ttbd user to the user who can access the
# resources it will need.
#
# Requirements:
# - Python package sdnotify (pip install sdnotify)
#

[Unit]
Description = Test Targer Broker Daemon %I
# We need network to be online (require) but want to start after it is
# done starting
Requires = network-online.target
After = network-online.target
# Say there is a daemon that controls the infrastructure
#Requires = ttbd@infrastructure.service

[Service]
# Run ExcecStartPre as root
PermissionsStartOnly = True
# Some needed tools might configure themselves in /etc/environment
# (-: do not fail if file does not exist)
EnvironmentFile = -/etc/environment

# - CAP_AUDIT_WRITE: [bounding] so sudo can send audit messages and
#   not die trying

# - CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH: [ambient] for ttbl.rsync.pci, which can be
#   started to serve images to install in other machines -- this is
#   dropped by the daemon and given to rsync as inherited capability

# - CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE & CAP_FOWNER: [bounding] access files of other
#   users once we sudo

# - CAP_NET_ADMIN: [ambient] to be able to setup network interfaces
# - from within the daemon calling ip and other network setup tools

# - CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE: [ambient] to start dhcpd and
#   be able to attach to network ports < 1024 as given in
#   configuration (for example, to listen in well known ports)

# - CAP_NET_RAW: for DHCPd and tcpdump

# - CAP_SETUID & CAP_SETGID: [bounding] to be able to run
#   sudo/suid,sgid from inside us

# - CAP_SYS_ADMIN: [bounding] so sudo-launched helpers can do stuff,
#   but the daemon itself doesn't need them. Things like re-reading
#   partition tables, etc

# - CAP_SYS_CHROOT: [ambient] for running rsync as a server FIXME:
#   should we drop and just inherit like CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH?
