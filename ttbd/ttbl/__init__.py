    >>>         default = "serial0",
    >>>     )
    >>> )

    creates an instance of the *console* interface with access to two
    console. The interface is then available over HTTP
    ``https://SERVER/ttb-vN/target/TARGETNAME/console/*``

    A common pattern for interfaces is to be composed of multiple
    components, with a different implementation driver for each. For
    that, a class named *impl_c* is created to define the base
    interface that all the implementation drivers need to support.

    To create methods that are served over the
    ``https://SERVER/ttb-vN/target/TARGETNAME/INTERFACENAME/*`` url,
    create methods in the subclass called *METHOD_NAME* with the
    signature:

    >>>     def METHOD_NAME(self, target, who, args, files, user_path):
    >>>         impl, component = self.arg_impl_get(args, "component")
    >>>         arg1 = args.get('arg1', None)
    >>>         arg2 = args.get('arg2', None)
    >>>         ...

    where:

    - *METHOD* is *put*, *get*, *post* or *delete* (HTTP methods)

    - *NAME* is the method name (eg: *set_state*)

    - *target* is the target object this call is happening onto

    - *who* is the (logged in) user making this call

    - *args* is a dictionary of arguments passed by the client for the
      HTTP call keyed by name (a string)

    - *files* dictionrary of files passed to the HTTP request (FIXME:
       doc properly)

    - *user_path* is a string describing the space in the filesystem
      where files for this user are stored

    Return values:

     - these methods can throw an exception on error (and an error code will
       be sent to the client)

     - a dictionary of keys and values to return to the client as JSON
       (so JSON encodeable).

       To stream a file as output, any other keys are ignored and the
       following keys are interpreted, with special meaning

       - *stream_file*: (string) the named file will be streamed to the client
       - *stream_offset*: (positive integer) the file *steam_file*
         will be streamed starting at the given offset.
       - *stream-generation*: (positive monotonically increasing
         integer) a number that describes the current iteration of
         this file that might be reset [and thus bringing its apparent
         size to the client to zero] upon certain operations (for
         example, for serial console captures, when the target power
         cycles, this number goes up and the capture size starts at
         zero).

       An X-stream-gen-offset header will be returned to the client
       with the string *GENERATION OFFSET*, where the current
       generation of the stream as provided and the offset that was
       used, possibly capped to the actual maximum offset are
       returned.

       This way the client can use OFFSET+Conten-Length to tell the
       next offset to query.

    When multiple components are used to implement the functionality
    of an interface or to expose multiple instruments that
    implement the functionality (such as in
    :class:`ttbl.power.interface` or :class:`ttbl.console.interface`),
    use methods:

          >>>     ( someotherthing, another_impl(args) ),
          >>> ))
