Drivers to create targets on virtual machine using QEMU
-------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: This deprecates all previous ttbl/tt_qemu*.py modules

These are all raw building block which requires extra
configuration. To create targets, use functions such as:

 - :func:`conf_00_lib_pos.target_qemu_pos_add`

 - :func:`conf_00_lib_mcu.target_qemu_zephyr_add`

These drivers implement different objects needed to implement targets
that run as QEMU virtual machines:

- :class:`pc`: a power rail controller to control a QEMU virtual
  machine running as a daemon, providing interfaces for
  starting/stopping, debugging, BIOS/kernel/initrd image flashing and
  exposes serial consoles that an be interacted with the
  :class:`ttbl.console.generic_c` object.

- :class:`qmp_c`: an object to talk to QEMU's control socket

- :class:`plugger_c`: an adaptor to plug physical USB devices to QEMU
  targets with the :mod:`ttbl.things` interface

- :class:`network_tap_pc`: a power rail controller to setup tap
  devices to a (virtual or physical) network device that represents a
  network.

PENDING
^^^^^^^

- move all inventory entries to proper hierarchies, so we can support
  multiple QEMU instances in the same target::

    qemu.* -> qemu.COMPONENT.*:

    qemu.AC.gdb-tcp.port
    qemu.AC.image-bios
    qemu.AC.pid
    qemu.AC.qmp

  Hinging on:

  - qemu-gdb-tcp-port defined in the command line, so we might have to
    update self.kws during on() to define those fixed from
    qemu.COMPONENT.gdb-tcp-port > qemu-gdb-tcp-port

  - same with the images; we need to improve the handling of this so
    that we have a  kinda mapping of each QEMU instance which images
    it takes / provides to the interface.

  - vnc-* -> vnc.COMPONENT.{host,port,tcp-port}

  - tuntap-IC -> interconnects[IC].tuntap?

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- as of version 5.1.? of QEMU, the console support that relied on
  using *-chardev*'s *logfile* option no longer works:

  - When combined with *socket*, it blocks until the write side is
    written to, even when *nowait* is issued

  - Switching to PTYs works, but at some point the the logfile stops
    being updated--unknown reason

  thus the implementation has been switched to not have QEMU write
  the logfile but the consoles to use socat to either read/write the
  unix socket or the PTY; adds another process, but removes on QEMU
  quirkiness to the well tested socat implementation.

- If wanting to use KVM, the BIOS needs to allow it; if when
  modprobing, eg, kvm_intel it prints::

    [3765190.723964] kvm: support for 'kvm_intel' disabled by bios

  ensure KVM is enabled in the BIOS; setting names depend on the CPU
  and BIOS, but look for htings such as:

    - Processor Setting > Virtualization Technology
    - Integrated Devices > I/OAT DMA Engine

    """Power controller that manages a QEMU instance

    This object exposes:

    - power control interface: to start / stop QEMU
    - images interface: to specify the kernel / initrd / BIOS images
    - debug interface: to manage the virtual CPUs, debug via GDB

    A target can be created and this object attached to the multiple
    interfaces to expose said functionalities, like for example
    (pseudo code):

    >>> target = ttbl.test_target("name")
    >>> qemu_pc = ttbl.qemu.pc([ "/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64", ... ])
    >>> target.interface_add("power", ttbl.power.interface(qemu_pc))
    >>> target.interface_add("debug", ttbl.debug.interface(qemu_pc))
    >>> target.interface_add("images", ttbl.images.interface(qemu_pc))

    For a complete, functional example that uses this to create
    target/s see :func:`conf_00_lib_pos.target_qemu_pos_add` or
    :func:`conf_00_lib_mcu.target_qemu_zephyr_add`.

    :param list(str) qemu_cmdline: command line to start QEMU,
      specified as a list of *[ PATH, ARG1, ARG2, ... ]*.

      Don't add *-daemonize*! This way the daemon is part of the process
      tree and killed when we kill the parent process

      Note this will be passed to :class:`ttbl.power.daemon_c`, so
      '%(FIELD)s' will be expanded with the tags and runtime
      properties of the target.

    :param str nic_model: (optional) Network Interface Card emulation
      used to create a network interface; defaults to
      *virtio-net-pci*. Note this argument is passed to QEMU's
      *-device*, so only those names will be valid.

    **General design notes**

    - the driver will add command line to create a QMP access socket
      (to control the instance and launch the VM stopped), a GDB
      control socket and a PID file. Thus, don't specify *-qmp*,
      *-pidfile*, *-S* or *-gdb* on the command line.

    - any command line is allowed as long as it doesn't interfere with
      those.

    - as in all the TCF server code, these might be called from
      different processes who share the same configuration; hence we
      can't rely on any runtime storage. Any runtime values that are
      needed are kept on a filesystem database (`self.fsdb`).

      We start the process with Python's subprocess.Popen(), but then
      it goes on background and if the parent dies, the main server
      process will reap it (as prctl() has set with SIG_IGN on
      SIGCHLD) and any subprocess of the main process might kill it
      when power-off is called on it. :class:`ttbl.power.daemon_c`
      takes care of all that.

    **Firmware interface: What to load/run**

    The :class:`images <ttbl.images.interface>` interface can be used
    to direct QEMU to load BIOS/kernel/initrd images. Otherwise, it
    will execute stuff off the disk (if the command line is set
    correctly). This is done by setting the target properties:

    - *qemu-image-bios*

    - *qemu-image-kernel*

    - *qemu-image-initrd*

    these can be set to the name of a file in the server's namespace,
    normally off the user storage area (FIXME: implement this limit in
    the flash() interface, allow specifics for POS and such).

    Additionally, *qemu-image-kernel-args* can be set to arguments to
    the kernel.

    **Serial consoles**

    This driver doesn't intervene on serial consoles (if wanted or
    not). The way to create serial consoles is to add command line
    such as:

    >>> cmdline += [
    >>>     "-chardev", "pty,id=NAME",
    >>>     "-serial", "chardev:NAME"
    >>> ]

    where *NAME* is the console name and must match the name it will
    be registered as in the console interface later on with:

    >>> console_pc = ttbl.console.general_pc()
    >>> ttbl.interface_impl_add("console", NAME, console_pc)
    >>> ttbl.interface_impl_add("power", NAME, console_pc)   # to auto-start on power-on

    which makes QEMU create a PTY for each serial console we want to
    define; on power on, *ttbl.qemy.pc._qemu_console_on()* will find
    the PTY devices created and symlink
    *TARGETSTATEDIR/console-NAME.write* to said PTY
    device. :class:`ttbl.console.general_pc` will connect that to the
    console subsystem for the console interface to be able to expose
    QEMU's serial consoles.

    **Networking**

    For a QEMU target to have networking, it has to be a member of a
    network target (interconnect) [e.g. a network defined with
    :class:`conf_00_lib.nw_pos_add`].

    The general network support then relies on creating a virtual
    network device over a TAP device associated to each target and
    interconnect they are connected to (implemented by
    :class:`ttbl.qemu.network_tap_pc`); the device is created upon
    power on:

    >>> target = ttbl.test_target("name")
    >>> target.add_to_interconnect(
    >>>     'nwa', dict(
    >>>         mac_addr = "02:61:00:00:00:05",
    >>>         ipv4_addr = "192.168.97.5",
    >>>         ipv6_addr = "fd:00:61::05")
    >>> qemu_pc = ttbl.qemu.pc([ "/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64", ... ])
    >>> target.interface_add(
    >>>     "power",
    >>>     ttbl.power.interface(
    >>>         ( "tuntap-nwa", ttbl.qemu.network_tap_pc() ),
    >>>         qemu_pc,
    >>> )

    the driver automatically adds the command line to add correspoding
    network devices for each interconnect the target is a member of.

    It is possible to do NAT or other networking setups; the command
    line needs to be specified manually though.

    **Booting and Provisionining**

    Look at :func:`conf_00_lib_pos.target_qemu_pos_add` for details on
    a way to have a QEMU based target provision over the network

    represents the interconnect has created when powering on
    (:class:`conf_00_lib.vlan_pci`)--it will assign it in the TCF
    server the IP addresses described above.

    The name of the interface created is stored in a target property
    called as the component (for our example, it will be a property
    called *tuntap-nwka*) so that other components can use it:

    - For QEMU, for example, you need a command line such as::

        -nic tap,model=ETH_NIC_MODEL,script=no,downscript=no,ifname=IFNAME

      however, the :class:`ttbl.qemu.pc` driver automatically
      recognizes a *tuntap-NETWORKNAME* is there and inserts the
      command line needed.

    When the target is powered off, this component will just remove
    the interface.
