Power control module to start a dnsmasq daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A DNSMASQ daemon is created that can be attached to a network
interface to:

- resolve DNS requests for all the targets attached to a test network
- serves DHCP requests to hosts in the interconnect's network
- serves TFTP files from TARGETDIR/tftp.root

Note this will conflict with other DHCP or TFTP servers running in the
same hosts, but it will *only* serve in the interface it is associated
to the interconnect target it is made a power rail of.

Pending:

- IPv6 support not very tested.

- allow to switch which functionalities are needed

  - tftp on/off

  - default route on/off

- allowing adding more names/IP-addresses to the database at will

Note configuration entries for DNSMASQ follow the command line names
(without the leading --) and the source for DNSMASQ is at
http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html.

    """Start / stop a dnsmasq daemon to resolve DNS requests to a given
    network interface

    :param str ifname: (optional; default target's name) name of the
      network interface to attach dnsmasq to.

    :param bool tftp: (optional; default *True*) enable TFTP

    This is meant to be used in the power rail of an interconnect
    target that represents a network to which the server is physically
    connected.

    Upon power on, it collects the list of targets connecte to the
    interconnect and creates IPv4 and IPv6 address records for them
    (short form *TARGETNAME*, longform *TARGETNAME.INTERCONNECTNAME*);
    the dnsmasq daemon will then resolve those names from queries from
    the targets.

    For example: the server configures the interconnect *nwa*, to
      which it has physical access on a given interface on IP address
      192.168.97.1 (as configured in the interconnect's tags)::

        $ tcf list -vv nwa
        server/nwa
          id: nwa
          ipv4_addr: 192.168.97.1
          ...

      Target *qu-90a* is connected to network *nwa*, and thus it
      declares in its tags *interconnects.nwa*::

        $ tcf list -vv qu-90a
        server/qu-90a
          id: qu-90a
          interconnects.nwa.ipv4_addr: 192.168.97.90

      DNSMASQ (on 192.168.97.1#53) will resolve *qu-90a.nwa* when
      queried from inside the network *nwa* to 192.168.97.90.

    Use in the cpower rail to an interconnect, it won't work with a
    target that does not define tags *ipv4_addr*.

    .. code-block:: python

       interconnect.interface_add(
           "power",
           ttbl.power.interface(
               ...
               ( "dnsmasq", ttbl.dnsmasq.pc() ),
           ))

    A console can be configured to see all the log messages reported
    by *dnsmasq* with the following:

    .. code-block:: python

       target.interface_impl_add(
           "console", "log-dnsmasq",
           ttbl.console.logfile_c("dnsmasq.log")
       )

    (this works because :class:`ttbl.console.logfile_c` will read a
    called *dnsmasq.log* in the target's state directory); running::

      $ tcf console-read TARGETNAME -c log-dnsmasq

    reads the log file; while::

      $ tcf console-setup TARGETNAME -c log-dnsmasq

    wipes the log file


    **Inventory fields**

    These will be taken in the following order:

    - *TARGET.interconnects.ICNAME.FIELD*
    - *IC.FIELD*

    The following are recognized:

    - *default_route*: bool, string: (optional; default *True*)

      - *True*: a default route will be sent by the DHCP server with
        .1 being the gateway

      - *False*: no default route will be sent by the DHCP server

      - *value*: a default route will be set and the gateway will be
        *value*, which shall be an IP address in the right range.

    - *default_route6*: same as *default_route*, but for IPv6.

    FIXME/PENDING:
     - ipv6 address binding.
     - interface name for --interface is hardcoded; need to obtain
       automatically from the IP address
