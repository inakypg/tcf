#
# Simple dockerfile to create an image that can run the TCF client
#
# Build as:
#
#  # cd .../tcf.git
#  $ buildah bud -t tcf -v $PWD:/home/work/tcf.git:O --label version="$(git describe --always)" -f client.Dockerfile
#
# Run under the container without registry::
#
#  $ podman run -v $HOME/.tcf:/home/work/.tcf:O tcf ls
#
# Push to a registry::
#
#  $ buildah push localhost/tcf REGISTRY/IMAGENAME/tcf:latest
#
# Run under the the container::
#
#  $ podman run -v $HOME/.tcf:/home/work/.tcf:O tcf tcf ls
#
# don't use fedora-minimal or it'll start pruning things we need (like /usr/share/zoneinfo)

# container images all the deps needed to build TCF itself, but it picks
# up also the ones needed to run the server (the client package) so
# when building the container we tell it to skip that.
