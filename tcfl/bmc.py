"""Common utilities for configuring and dealing with BMCs/IPMI
===========================================================

BMCs (baseboard management controllers) are included on some machines,
and can be accessed via a local interface from the machine's OS or
remotely via IPMI or Redfish protocols.

When present for use/configuration/testing in a machine, the BMCs can
be used as instrumentation (to control the machine) or as a subject of
testing and execution.

When subject for testing and execution, the following information will
be included in the inventory:

BMC Inventory
-------------

.. _inventory_bmc:

FIXME: this table has horrible formatting when rendered, figure out
how to make the columns narrower so it is readable

.. list-table:: BMC Inventory
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 10 10 60
   :width: 50%

   * - Field name
     - Type
       (str, bool, integer,
       float, dictionary)
     - Disposition
       (mandatory, recommended,
       optional[default])
     - Description

   * - bmcs
     - Dictionary
     - Optional
     - Information about the different BMCs in the system; most
       commonly there is a single BMC; the first BMC is calle *bmc0*,
       the second *bmc1*, then *bmc2*...

   * - bmcs.bmc0
     - Dictionary
     - Optional
     - Description of the first BMC; the description here apply to the
       rest of the BMCs in *bmc1*, *bmc2*, etc ...

   * - bmcs.bmc0.id
     - int (>= 0)
     - Mandatory
     - Index of this BMC in the system; this will be mapped, in an OS
       specific way. For example, in Linux, index 0 (the first BMC)
       would be mapped to */dev/ipmi0*; as well, when using the
       *ipmitool* command would use *ipmitool -d 0* to refer to it
       from within the system.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.users
     - dictionary
     - Mandatory
     - List of usernames and their passwords; these username and
       passwords are configured in the BMC to use in all the
       interfaces (IPMI from within the system or network) with admin
       privileges.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.mc
     - dictionary
     - Optional
     - Information about the BMC (eg: as returned by *ipmitool mc info*),
       keyed by string, values being strings, integers, floats or bools.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.fru
     - dictionary
     - Optional
     - Information about the FRUs (Field Replaceable Units) reported
       by the BMC (eg: as returned by *ipmitool fru info*).

   * - bmcs.bmc0.fru.FRUNAME
     - dictionary
     - Optional
     - Information about the *FRUNAME*, keyed by string, values being
       strings, integers, floats or bools.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.user0.name
     - string
     - Optional
     - Name of the first user configured to access the BMC in all the
       channels.

       Note subsequent user names would be configured using
       *bmcs.bmc1.user1.name*, *bmcs.bmc2.user.name* ...

   * - bmcs.bmc0.user0.channels
     - string
     - Optional
     - List of integers separated with colons (eg: 1:2:3) describing
       on which channels this user entry shall be created; defaults to
       those specifed in all the network entries
       (*bmcs.bmcN.network\\*.channel*).

   * - bmcs.bmc0.user0.uid
     - integer (>= 0)
     - Optional
     - User ID to use (note User IDs are specific to each channel, but
       for simplicity we use the same for all channels)

   * - bmcs.bmc0.user0.password
     - string
     - Mandatory (if user name specified)
     - Password for the BMC user described in *bmcs.bmc0.user.name*.
       Note this can be considered a a security issue depending on how
       this BMC is configured and for what. If the BMC is considered
       part of what is being tested and the target is configured to be
       AC powered off once it is released, then knowing the password
       doesn't grant access to the BMC, since the BMC will be hard
       powered off.

       Note subsequent user passwords would be configured using
       *bmcs.bmc1.user.password*, *bmcs.bmc2.user.password* ...

   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0
     - dictionary
     - Optional
     - Dictionary describing the settings for the default network
       connections this BMC provides. Other network connections are
       called *network1*, *network2*, etc.... and follow the same fields
       as *bmcs.bmc0.network0*. This field is mandatory only if the BMC
       provides network access.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0.mac_addr
     - string
     - Optional
     - Ethernet MAC address for this BMC's network connection (if known)

   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0.ipv4_addr
     - string
     - Optional
     - IPv4 address for this BMC's network connection (if
       known). This is mandatory if the *ipv4_src* below is *static*.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0.ipv4_netmask
     - string
     - Optional
     - IPv4 network mask for this BMC's network connection (if
       known). This is mandatory if the *ipv4_src* below is *static*.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0.ipv4_gateway
     - string
     - Optional
     - IPv4 gateway address mask for this BMC's network connection (if
       known). This is always optional.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0.ipv4_src
     - string
     - Mandatory
     - Indicates the source of the IPv4 addressing information; valid
       settings are *static* or *dhcp*.

   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0.channel
     - integer
     - Mandatory
     - BMC channel used for this network connection (eg: 1, 3)

   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0.interface
     - integer
     - Optional
     - BMC interface to connect to this channel; this can be passed to
       the *ipmitool -I* command line option. Known values are *imb*,
       *lan*, *lanplus*, *open*, *serial-basic*, *serial-terminal*,
       *usb*.

       To obtain it for the *ipmitool* tool, for example:

       >>> interface = target.kws.get("bmcs.bmc0.network0.interface", None)
       >>> interface = f"-I {interface}" if interface else ""


   * - bmcs.bmc0.network0.cipher
     - integer
     - Optional
     - BMC cipher type to use to connect over the network; this is
       used for the *ipmitool -C* command line option. For example,
       for *OpenBMC* we need *17*.

       To obtain it for the *ipmitool* tool, for example:
     
       >>> cipher = target.kws.get("bmcs.bmc0.network0.cipher", None)
       >>> cipher = f"-C {cipher}" if cipher else ""

   * - bmcs.bmc1
     - Dictionary
     - Optional
     - Description for the second BMC, same fields as *bmcs.bmc0*

   * - bmcs.bmc2
     - Dictionary
     - Optional
     - Description for the third BMC, same fields as *bmcs.bmc0*

From the POS execution environment, the utilities included here can be
used to reset or configure a BMC to well known settings; for example,
to power on in POS environment and setup all BMCs exposed on the
inventory:

>>> import tcfl.tc
>>> import tcfl.bmc
>>>
>>> @tcfl.tc.interconnect()
>>> @tcfl.tc.target("pos_capable")
>>> class _test(tcfl.tc.tc_c):
>>> 
>>>     def eval(self, target):
>>>         ic.power.on()
>>>         target.pos.boot_to_pos()
>>> 
>>>         tcfl.bmc.setup_discover_ipmitool(target, True)

The base utilities use the *IPMI* protocol since when the BMC is not
configured, there is no way to access it over the network to use
protocols such as *Redfish*.

See :func:`setup_discover_all_ipmitool`, :func:`setup_ipmitool` and
:func:`discover_ipmitool` for more information on inventory requirements.
