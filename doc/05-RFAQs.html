<h2>5.1. TCF is OS and test target agnostic<a class="headerlink" href="#tcf-is-os-and-test-target-agnostic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whatever your test target is (an MCU, a PC, a toaster), TCF doesn’t
care.</p>
<p>All the functionality is implemented by interfaces and drivers. The
only thing TCF does is (on the server side) manage access to the
targets and proxy requests via HTTP. On the client side, it just
launches tests however you tell him to do via the markup language of
choice to describe test cases.</p>

<div class="section" id="separated-networks-for-infrastructure-and-test-target-hardware">
<span id="separated-networks"></span><h2>5.2. Separated networks for infrastructure and test target hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#separated-networks-for-infrastructure-and-test-target-hardware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have test targets connected to the same network switch as (for
example) your power controllers, security issues are introduced.</p>
<p>An attacker could deploy a rogue image to a test node, sniff the
traffic in the network and gather access to the power switches (which
don’t have, in general, good security), thus disrupting the operation
and creating potential hazards.</p>
<p>Thus, the best deployment practice is to keep them in two separate and
isolate networks. This can also be accomplished with smart switches,
but it is out of the scope of this document.</p>

<div class="section" id="mcu-test-fixture-for-highest-reliabiltiy">
<span id="arduino101-rationale"></span><h2>5.3. MCU test fixture for highest reliabiltiy<a class="headerlink" href="#mcu-test-fixture-for-highest-reliabiltiy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The fixture described in <a class="reference internal" href="09-api.html#conf_00_lib.arduino101_add" title="conf_00_lib.arduino101_add"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">conf_00_lib.arduino101_add()</span></code></a> can be
considered complicated, but it is designed for maximum reliability
when running thousands of test cases. These same points apply to other
(most) MCUs under test.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Current leaks</p>
<p>The board is so sensitive to current leakage that it will be
residually powered on even when just connecting the serial
console. This will charge some capacitors. Then it will work for a few
millisecs, enough to print some trash to the serial console and die.</p>
<p>All the components have to be connected to the same ground to avoid
derivations, which means to the same YKUSH switchable USB hub and
then powered up and down in an specific order via a power rail.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why power off everthing? Why not just power off the board?</p>
<p>It has been found via experimentation that sometimes the only way to
fully reset an Arduino 101 (and any MCU for that matter) is to
completely disconnect every cable and let it sit for a few seconds.</p>
<p>This is related to the previous point, current leakage can disallow
the board ressetting properly.</p>
<p>Humans can do this by disconnecting all the cables; the automation
system does it by having all this power cutters completely isolating
the board.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Question: (on Zephyr) I’m a little confused why I actually need to
power cycle the Arduino, when I compile zephyr and flash using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span>
<span class="pre">BOARD=Arduino_101_factory</span> <span class="pre">flash</span></code> I don’t need [any hardware] to
power it down…  Zephyr <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">flash</span></code> seems to be using OpenOCD just
like TCF.</p>
<p>It does, and it is misleadingly simple.</p>
<p>When doing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">flash</span></code>, there is an OpenOCD-driven reset that is
done there; if it doesn’t work, a human retries, if it doesn’t work
again, the mailing list wisdom has been <cite>disconnect every single
cable to the board, let it rest a few seconds, reconnect again,
retry</cite>.</p>
<p>TCF does the same, but faster and without your intervention, but for
that it needs hardware.</p>
<p>TCF is designed to run tests cases with no human intervention, one
after another as fast as possible. If it fails, it recovers. In
order to do that, reliably, the board has to be fully reset. And for
that it uses that hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why power off the USB bus versus the barrel?</p>
<p>The choice to use USB is that in most setups, power comes from USB
anyway and there is no real reason to use the barrel.</p>
<p>It simplifies the cabling too. Using the barrel you have to make
sure that the power is connected to the same power switch as the hub
where the MCU is connected to avoid ground power derivation.</p>
<p>As well, if you choose to use the barrel and USB, then note either
will power it, so when the power rail powers up the target,
whichever USB power controller or the barrel power controller is
turned on first will power the whole board up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="high-cost-of-fixtures">
<h2>5.4. High cost of fixtures<a class="headerlink" href="#high-cost-of-fixtures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All the extra hardware needed to run the fixtures can get expensive:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>~$40 for an YKUSH hub and cables</li>
<li>~$130 for a DLWPs7 if deciding to implement full power control</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>however, it needs to be put inperspective:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the cost of the infrastructure is spread across the test targets</li>
<li>humans take a long time to do things: reconnecting all cables for a
solid power cycle a few times a day will add up to a lot of time</li>
<li>removal of the human error factor: which can lead to false positives
and negatives which will cause extra resource consumption on
diagnosis</li>
<li>reduce wear and tear: plugging and unplugging wears the boards down,
loosens connectors and deceases the life expectancy of the hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of investing full automation is rapidly offset by the
savings in human time (and their burn rate) and increased efficiency.</p>

<p class="last">time spent looking around for cables is wasted money; order
